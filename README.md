# Social-Distancing-Detector
   Social Distancing Detection using Deep Learning
   
Background: 
      One of the tasks for Computer Vision Intership from the Sparks Foundation.
  
Algorithm:
  1) Detect people from the frame using YOLO v3
  2) Compute Pairwise Distances Between Centroids of detected objects
  3) Check distance matrix whether they follow social distancing rule or not
  4) Change bounding box color if it violates the rule
  5) Write output video file
