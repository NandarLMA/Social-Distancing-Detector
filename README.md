# Social-Distancing-Detector
Social Distancing Detection using Deep Learning to evaluate the distance between people

Abstract:
  This is one of the tasks from the Sparks Foundation's virtual function IOT and computer vision intern.
  
Algorithm:
  1) Detect people from the frame using YOLO v3
  2) Compute Pairwise Distances Between Centroids of detected objects
  3) Check distance matrix whether they follow social distancing rule or not
  4) Change bounding box color according to violation 
  5) Write to output video file
